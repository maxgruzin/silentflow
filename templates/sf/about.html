            <h2>Silent Flow is a free digital music distribution platform.</h2>
            <br>
            All our releases are available for free, we do not benefit from music in any way.
            Our only goal is to promote our artists and music they create.
            <br><br>
            Consider Silent Flow as another source of distributing music â€“ artists still hold the right to all their works and can distribute or publish them by themselves.
            All releases are published under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ ">Creative Commons license</a>.
